## Learn Basics of Rust - Building Guessing game

>Learning by doing is always the best way to learn new concepts. It's a mixed moments of "Got it" and when you try things, you might wonder "What did I missed out" and checks some syntax corrections and finally to building something that you are proud of.

This hands-on includes 4 part- excercises, focused on learning concepts who might want to start learning rust programming.
Each excercise can be followed with step by step guide, where you will learn the concepts while you build.

Below are the branch names, you can checkout into and learn the concepts,
1. [`01-Setting-up`](https://github.com/krtkeyan/Rust-Learning-Basics-01-Guessing-game/tree/01-Setting-up) ( Installtion and running rust programs )
2. [`02-getting-input-and-variables`](https://github.com/krtkeyan/Rust-Learning-Basics-01-Guessing-game/tree/02-getting-input-and-variables)
3. [`03-external-dependencies-and-match-expr`](https://github.com/krtkeyan/Rust-Learning-Basics-01-Guessing-game/tree/03-external-dependencies-and-match-expr)
4. [`04-loops-and-finish-up-guessing-game`](https://github.com/krtkeyan/Rust-Learning-Basics-01-Guessing-game/tree/04-loops-and-finish-up-guessing-game)

To start playing with the guessing game, [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/krtkeyan/Rust-Learning-Basics-01-Guessing-game) and run `cargo run` in the terminal.


## Concepts you will learn, while you building guessing game

1. First steps, Basics of compiling & running with Cargo.
2. `use` statement - to bring methods, traits into scope
3. Creating variables, Shadowing variables ( Mutatable & Immutable )
4. Getting standard input from terminal
5. Printing value to the standard output
6. Adding external crates into the application
7. `match` expression and arm pattern for decision making
8. `loop` keyword, `break` and `continue`
9. Handling errors using `expect`
